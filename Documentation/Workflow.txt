How does the CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Development) chain work:

I) Fork the main repository from GitHub.
  1) Make sure you have git installed (Google "how to install git on <your OS>").
  2) Open the terminal.
  3) cd path/to/project/folder
  4) Fork the repo using this guide: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/ (needed only once)
  5) Synchronize the fork for the latest updates using this guide: https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/

II) Write your code.

III) Commit and push to GitHub.
  1) cd path/to/project/folder
  2) git add *
  3) git commit -m "Commit message (describes what you did), closes #<issue number>."
  4) git push
  5) Enter login and password to access the forked repo.
  6) Submit a pull request using this giude: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/

IV) GitHub sends a webhook to the remote Jenkins installation on Amazon AWS.

V) Jenkins uploads the code changes to the 000webhost FTP server.

VI) The changes should be visible on the website link.
