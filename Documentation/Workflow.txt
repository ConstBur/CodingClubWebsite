How does the CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Development) chain work:

I) Clone the created repository from GitHub.
  1) Make sure you have git installed (Google "how to install git on <your OS>").
  2) Open the terminal.
  3) cd path/to/project/folder
  4) git clone <GitHub repo link, available via the "Clone or download" button on the repo root in browser>

II) Write your code.

III) Commit and push to GitHub.
  1) cd path/to/project/folder
  2) git add *
  3) git commit -m "Commit message (describes what you did)."
  4) git push
  5) Enter login and password to access the repository.

IV) GitHub sends a webhook to the remote Jenkins installation on Amazon AWS.

V) Jenkins uploads the code changes to the 000webhost FTP server.

VI) The changes should be visible on the website link.
